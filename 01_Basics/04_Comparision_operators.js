// Relational Operators:-

// console.log(2 > 1) // greater than
// console.log(2 >= 1) // greater than equal to
// console.log(2 < 1) // less than
// console.log(2 <= 1) // less than equal to
// console.log(2 == 1) // equal to 
// console.log(2 === 1) // equal to(strict checking)
// console.log(2 != 1) // not equal to

// Note:- a statement including a relational operator will always return a boolean output (true/False)

// strict checking means like in case of '==' if we compare 2 and '2' it will return true as '2' will be converted to number over here just because there is no strict checking, but in case of strict checking (i.e. '===') it will return false.

//Comparision between different data types:-

//console.log(null > 0) // output: false
// explaination: Here, in this case null is converted to NaN and comparing null with NaN will always return false

//console.log(null == 0) // output: false
// explaination: Here, in this case null is converted to NaN and comparing null with NaN will always return false

//console.log(null >= 0) // output: true
// explaination: since the equal to opeartor and the greater than and less operator than behaves differently that's why here in this case null is converted to 0 and hence the expression return true.

// Some comparisions (forget about logic just have a look on it and that's it.):-
// console.log(undefined == 0) output: false
// console.log(undefined > 0) output: false

// console.log(undefined < 0) output: false
